 * cds_lfht_node: Contains the next pointers and reverse-hash
 * value required for lookup and traversal of the hash table.
 *
 * struct cds_lfht_node should be aligned on 8-bytes boundaries because
 * the three lower bits are used as flags. It is worth noting that the
 * information contained within these three bits could be represented on
 * two bits by re-using the same bit for REMOVAL_OWNER_FLAG and
 * BUCKET_FLAG. This can be done if we ensure that no iterator nor
 * updater check the BUCKET_FLAG after it detects that the REMOVED_FLAG
 * is set. Given the minimum size of struct cds_lfht_node is 8 bytes on
 * 32-bit architectures, we choose to go for simplicity and reserve
 * three bits.
 *
 * struct cds_lfht_node can be embedded into a structure (as a field).
 * caa_container_of() can be used to get the structure from the struct
 * cds_lfht_node after a lookup.
 *
 * The structure which embeds it typically holds the key (or key-value
 * pair) of the object. The caller code is responsible for calculation
 * of the hash value for cds_lfht APIs.
