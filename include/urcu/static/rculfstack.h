 * Lock-free stack push is not subject to ABA problem, so no need to
 * take the RCU read-side lock. Even if "head" changes between two
 * uatomic_cmpxchg() invocations here (being popped, and then pushed
 * again by one or more concurrent threads), the second
 * uatomic_cmpxchg() invocation only cares about pushing a new entry at
 * the head of the stack, ensuring consistency by making sure the new
 * node->next is the same pointer value as the value replaced as head.
 * It does not care about the content of the actual next node, so it can
 * very well be reallocated between the two uatomic_cmpxchg().
 *
 * We take the approach of expecting the stack to be usually empty, so
 * we first try an initial uatomic_cmpxchg() on a NULL old_head, and
 * retry if the old head was non-NULL (the value read by the first
 * uatomic_cmpxchg() is used as old head for the following loop). The
 * upside of this scheme is to minimize the amount of cacheline traffic,
 * always performing an exclusive cacheline access, rather than doing
 * non-exclusive followed by exclusive cacheline access (which would be
 * required if we first read the old head value). This design decision
 * might be revisited after more thorough benchmarking on various
 * platforms.
 *
 * Returns 0 if the stack was empty prior to adding the node.
 * Returns non-zero otherwise.
