/**
 * _rcu_dereference - reads (copy) a RCU-protected pointer to a local variable
 * into a RCU read-side critical section. The pointer can later be safely
 * dereferenced within the critical section.
 *
 * This ensures that the pointer copy is invariant thorough the whole critical
 * section.
 *
 * Inserts memory barriers on architectures that require them (currently only
 * Alpha) and documents which pointers are protected by RCU.
 *
 * The compiler memory barrier in CMM_LOAD_SHARED() ensures that value-speculative
 * optimizations (e.g. VSS: Value Speculation Scheduling) does not perform the
 * data read before the pointer read by speculating the value of the pointer.
 * Correct ordering is ensured because the pointer is read as a volatile access.
 * This acts as a global side-effect operation, which forbids reordering of
 * dependent memory operations. Note that such concern about dependency-breaking
 * optimizations will eventually be taken care of by the "memory_order_consume"
 * addition to forthcoming C++ standard.
 *
 * Should match rcu_assign_pointer() or rcu_xchg_pointer().
 *
 * This macro is less than 10 lines long.  The intent is that this macro
 * meets the 10-line criterion in LGPL, allowing this function to be
 * expanded directly in non-LGPL code.
