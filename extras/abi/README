This directory contains the serialized ABI definitions for a typical build of
the liburcu librairies. This information is extracted using libabigail
(https://sourceware.org/libabigail/).

The artefacts used to generate these were built with CFLAGS="-O0 -ggdb".

You can compare the serialized ABI with a shared object to check for breaking
changes. For example, here we compare an in-tree built version of
liburcu-memb.so with the serialized ABI of stable-0.13 :

  abidiff \
    extras/abi/0.13/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/liburcu-memb.so.7.xml \
    src/.libs/liburcu-memb.so
