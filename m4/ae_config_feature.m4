# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AE_FEATURE(FEATURE-NAME, FEATURE-DESCRIPTION,
#              ACTION-IF-GIVEN?, ACTION-IF-NOT-GIVEN?,
#              ACTION-IF-ENABLED?, ACTION-IF-NOT-ENABLED?)
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   AE_FEATURE is a simple wrapper for AC_ARG_ENABLE.
#
#   FEATURE-NAME should consist only of alphanumeric characters, dashes,
#   plus signs, and dots.
#
#   FEATURE-DESCRIPTION will be formatted with AS_HELP_STRING.
#
#   If the user gave configure the option --enable-FEATURE or --disable-FEATURE,
#   run shell commands ACTION-IF-GIVEN. If neither option was given, run shell
#   commands ACTION-IF-NOT-GIVEN. The name feature indicates an optional
#
#   If the feature is enabled, run shell commands ACTION-IF-ENABLED, if it is
#   disabled, run shell commands ACTION-IF-NOT-ENABLED.
#
#   A FEATURE has 3 different states, enabled, disabled and undefined. The first
#   two are self explanatory, the third state means it's disabled by default
#   and it was not explicitly enabled or disabled by the user or by the
#   AE_FEATURE_ENABLE and AE_FEATURE_DISABLE macros.
#
#   A feature is disabled by default, in order to change this behaviour use the
#   AE_FEATURE_DEFAULT_ENABLE and AE_FEATURE_DEFAULT_DISABLE
#   macros.
#
#   A simple example:
#
#     AE_FEATURE_DEFAULT_ENABLE
#     AE_FEATURE(feature_xxxxx, [turns on/off XXXXX support])
#
#     ...
#
#     AE_FEATURE_DEFAULT_DISABLE
#     AE_FEATURE(feature_yyyyy, [turns on/off YYYYY support])
#     AM_CONDITIONAL(YYYYY, AE_IS_FEATURE_ENABLED([feature_yyyyy]))
#
#     AE_FEATURE_DEFAULT_ENABLE
#     AE_FEATURE(...)
#
#     ...
#
#   Use AE_FEATURE_ENABLE or AE_FEATURE_DISABLE in order to
#   enable or disable a specific feature.
#
#   Another simple example:
#
#     AS_IF([some_test_here],[AE_FEATURE_ENABLE(feature_xxxxx)],[])
#
#     AE_FEATURE(feature_xxxxx, [turns on/off XXXXX support],
#                       HAVE_XXXXX, [Define if you want XXXXX support])
#     AE_FEATURE(feature_yyyyy, [turns on/off YYYYY support],
#                       HAVE_YYYYY, [Define if you want YYYYY support])
#
#     ...
#
#   NOTE: AE_FEATURE_ENABLE/DISABLE() must be placed first of the relative
#   AE_FEATURE() macro if you want the the proper ACTION-IF-ENABLED and
#   ACTION-IF-NOT-ENABLED to run.
